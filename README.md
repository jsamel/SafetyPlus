Safety+
==========
Safety contact information aggregator Android application

The one-stop mobile application for all your safety contact needs!

Safety+ is an Android application built to pull the name, address, and phone number of all of the nearest relevant safety contacts based on your current GPS location.
These contacts include police department, fire department, hospital, dentist, city hall, and more.

The application queries the Google Places API to determine the various fields, then populates the pages on click.
The Weather Underground API is also used to query for any weather alerts in the phone's region.

Clicking the name or address will bring you to Google Maps with directions there from the phone's current location.
Clicking the button with the phone number will call the number. 
Clicking the weather alerts bar will open a page with more details about alerts.

The intent is to release to the Google Play store in the near future.
